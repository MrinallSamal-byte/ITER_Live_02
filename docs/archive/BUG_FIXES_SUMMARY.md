# 🎯 Bug Fixes and Improvements Summary

## ✅ Completed Fixes

### 1. **Critical API Route Issues** (FIXED)
**Problem**: Student dashboard was calling non-existent API endpoints
- `/api/student/attendance` → 404
- `/api/student/marks` → 404
- `/api/student/assignments` → 404
- `/api/student/events` → 404
- `/api/student/files` → 404
- `/api/student/timetable` → 404

**Solution**: Updated `client/js/student.js` to use correct endpoints:
- ✅ `/api/attendance/student/:id` - Loads attendance with proper summary
- ✅ `/api/marks/student/:id` - Loads marks and calculates GPA
- ✅ `/api/events` - Lists all active events
- ✅ `/api/assignments/student` - Gets student-specific assignments
- ✅ `/api/files?approved=true` - Fetches approved files
- ✅ `/api/timetable` - Gets role-based timetable

**Files Modified**:
- `client/js/student.js` - All 6 API functions updated with proper error handling

---

### 2. **Missing Teacher Routes** (FIXED)
**Problem**: Teacher dashboard calls weren't routed in server
- `/api/teacher/*` endpoints existed but weren't mounted

**Solution**: Added teacher routes to server
- ✅ Added `const teacherRoutes = require('./routes/teacher.routes');`
- ✅ Mounted route: `app.use('/api/teacher', teacherRoutes);`

**Files Modified**:
- `server/index.js` - Added teacher route import and mounting

---

### 3. **Missing Avatar Files** (FIXED)
**Problem**: Profile system looking for non-existent avatar
- `/uploads/avatars/default-avatar.png` → 404

**Solution**: Created default avatar and updated profile partial
- ✅ Created `uploads/avatars/default-avatar.svg`
- ✅ Updated `client/partials/top-right-profile.html` to use SVG
- ✅ Added fallback: `onerror="this.src='/assets/logo.svg'"`

**Files Modified**:
- `uploads/avatars/default-avatar.svg` - New SVG avatar created
- `client/partials/top-right-profile.html` - Updated both avatar images

---

### 4. **Dashboard Null Reference Errors** (FIXED - Previously)
**Problem**: JavaScript couldn't find HTML elements
- `Cannot set properties of null (reading 'textContent')`

**Solution**: Added null-safe checks and missing HTML elements
- ✅ `student.html` - Added studentName span and profileControlContainer
- ✅ `teacher.html` - Added teacherName span and profileControlContainer
- ✅ `admin.html` - Added adminName span and profileControlContainer
- ✅ `student.js` - Added null checks for all element references
- ✅ `teacher.js` - Added null checks
- ✅ `admin.js` - Added null checks

---

### 5. **Logo 404 Errors** (FIXED - Previously)
**Problem**: Logo.png doesn't exist, causing 404 errors

**Solution**: Added error handlers to all logo images
- ✅ All dashboard nav logos: `onerror="this.style.display='none'"`
- ✅ Login/Register pages: Same error handling

**Files Modified**:
- `client/dashboard/student.html`
- `client/dashboard/teacher.html`
- `client/dashboard/admin.html`

---

### 6. **Manifest Icon 404s** (FIXED - Previously)
**Problem**: Manifest referenced non-existent PNG icons

**Solution**: Simplified manifest to only use existing logo.svg
- ✅ Removed icon-72.png through icon-512.png references
- ✅ Only references `/assets/logo.svg` which exists

**Files Modified**:
- `client/manifest.json`

---

### 7. **Storage System Enhancement** (FIXED - Previously)
**Problem**: localStorage blocked in some environments causing login failures

**Solution**: Multi-tier storage fallback system
- ✅ Primary: localStorage (best persistence)
- ✅ Fallback: sessionStorage (session-only persistence)
- ✅ Last resort: memoryStorage (no persistence across pages)

**Files Modified**:
- `client/js/main.js` - Storage object with triple fallback

---
