## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Developers

1. **Always Test Mobile First**
   ```
   Start at 320px width in DevTools
   Progressively test larger sizes
   Don't assume desktop works on mobile
   ```

2. **Use Provided Utility Classes**
   ```html
   <div class="hide-mobile">Desktop only</div>
   <div class="show-mobile">Mobile only</div>
   <div class="flex-column-mobile">Stacks on mobile</div>
   <div class="w-100-mobile">Full width mobile</div>
   ```

3. **Follow The Pattern**
   ```css
   /* Mobile first (default) */
   .element {
       font-size: 14px;
       padding: 1rem;
   }
   
   /* Enhance for larger screens */
   @media (min-width: 768px) {
       .element {
           font-size: 16px;
           padding: 2rem;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Test on Real Devices**
   ```
   DevTools is great but not perfect
   Test on actual phones/tablets
   Check both iOS and Android
   Test in portrait and landscape
   ```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Content Behind Bottom Nav
**Problem**: Content gets hidden behind fixed bottom nav on mobile

**Solution**: Already implemented in responsive.css
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .dashboard-main {
        padding-bottom: 90px;
    }
}
```

### Issue 2: iOS Input Zoom
**Problem**: iOS zooms in when focusing inputs with font-size < 16px

**Solution**: Already implemented in responsive.css
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    input, select, textarea {
        font-size: 16px !important;
    }
}
```

### Issue 3: Viewport Height on Mobile Browsers
**Problem**: 100vh includes browser chrome, causing overflow

**Solution**: Already implemented in mobile-nav.js
```javascript
const vh = window.innerHeight * 0.01;
document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--vh', `${vh}px`);
```

### Issue 4: Horizontal Scroll
**Problem**: Elements wider than viewport cause horizontal scroll

**Solution**: Already implemented in responsive.css
```css
body {
    overflow-x: hidden;
    width: 100%;
}
img, video, iframe {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```
