# Navigation Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Page Not Showing After Clicking Login Button
**Problem:** The login page was not accessible when clicking the login links on the main page.

**Root Cause:** The server was not properly configured to serve static HTML files (login.html, register.html, etc.) directly from the client folder.

**Solution:** Updated `server/index.js` to:
- Added `app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client')))` to serve all client files
- Added explicit route for root path: `app.get('/', (req, res) => { res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../client/index.html')) })`
- Modified 404 handler to only apply to `/api/*` routes, allowing HTML files to be served

### 2. Missing Registration Option
**Problem:** New users had no clear way to register from the main page.

**Solution:** Added registration links in multiple locations on `index.html`:
- **Navigation Bar:** Added "Register" button next to "Portal Login"
- **Hero Section:** Added "Register Now" button alongside "Student Portal" and "Learn More"
- **Footer:** Added "Register" link in the Quick Links section

## Files Modified

1. **server/index.js**
   - Added static file serving for client folder at root level
   - Added explicit route for index.html at root path
   - Modified 404 handler to only apply to API routes

2. **client/index.html**
   - Added registration button in navigation bar
   - Added registration button in hero section
   - Added registration link in footer

## How to Test

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd c:\All_In_One_College_Website
   npm start
   ```
   OR for development with auto-reload:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   - Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`
   - If using dev mode, the client runs on: `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Test Navigation:**
   - Click "Portal Login" button in the navbar → Should navigate to login page
   - Click "Student Portal" button in hero section → Should navigate to login page
   - Click "Register" button in navbar → Should navigate to registration page
   - Click "Register Now" button in hero section → Should navigate to registration page
   - Click "Register" link in footer → Should navigate to registration page

## Additional Notes

- All navigation links use relative paths (e.g., `login.html`, `register.html`)
- The server now serves static files from the `client` folder automatically
- Both login and registration pages already existed, they just weren't accessible due to server configuration
- The registration page supports both student and teacher registration
