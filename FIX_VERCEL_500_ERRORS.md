# Railway MySQL + Vercel Connection - Step by Step Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue

Your Vercel deployment returns **500 errors** because:
- Railway MySQL credentials are NOT configured in Vercel
- Vercel API cannot connect to the database

## ✅ Solution (Follow These Steps)

### STEP 1: Get Railway MySQL Credentials (2 minutes)

1. Go to **https://railway.app/dashboard**
2. Click on your **MySQL service** (or create new one if you don't have it)
3. Click on the **"Variables"** or **"Connect"** tab
4. Copy these 5 values:

```
MYSQLHOST     = _________________
MYSQLPORT     = _____ (usually 3306)
MYSQLUSER     = _____ (usually root)
MYSQLPASSWORD = _________________
MYSQLDATABASE = _____ (usually railway)
```

**Don't have Railway MySQL yet?**
- Go to https://railway.app/new
- Click "New Project" → "Provision MySQL"
- Wait 1-2 minutes
- Then copy credentials

---

### STEP 2: Run Setup Script (15 minutes)

This script will:
- Connect to Railway MySQL
- Create all tables
- Seed with dummy data (554 users + 680,000+ records)
- Generate Vercel configuration file

```powershell
node setup-railway-and-vercel.js
```

**What it will ask you:**
1. Enter Railway credentials (from Step 1)
2. Confirm seeding (say 'y')
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for data to be created

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Connected to Railway
✅ Database seeded
✅ 554 users created
✅ 680,000+ records added
✅ vercel-env-variables.txt created
```

---

### STEP 3: Configure Vercel (5 minutes)

1. Open the file: **vercel-env-variables.txt**
2. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
3. Click your project: **iter-college-management**
4. Navigate to: **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
5. Add EACH variable from the file:
   - Click "Add" for each variable
   - Copy name (e.g., `DB_HOST`)
   - Copy value
   - Click "Save"

**Variables to add:**
- ✅ DB_HOST
- ✅ DB_PORT
- ✅ DB_USER
- ✅ DB_PASSWORD
- ✅ DB_NAME
- ✅ JWT_SECRET
- ✅ JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
- ✅ JWT_EXPIRE
- ✅ JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRE
- ✅ NODE_ENV
- ✅ PORT
- ✅ CLIENT_URL
- ✅ CORS_WHITELIST
- ✅ RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS
- ✅ RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS

### STEP 4: Redeploy Vercel (2 minutes)

**Option A - From Dashboard:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Find latest deployment
5. Click "..." menu → "Redeploy"
6. Click "Redeploy" to confirm

**Option B - From Command Line:**
```powershell
vercel --prod
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete.

### STEP 5: Test Everything (2 minutes)

Run the test script:

```powershell
node test-vercel-deployment.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Website accessible
✅ API health check passes
✅ Admin login works
✅ Teacher login works
✅ Student login works
✅ Registration works
```

**Manual testing:**
1. Go to: https://iter-college-management.vercel.app/index.html
2. Click "Login"
3. Try these accounts:
   - **Admin**: admin1@iter.edu / Admin@123456
   - **Teacher**: teacher1@iter.edu / Teacher@123
   - **Student**: student1@iter.edu / Student@123

4. Check dashboards:
   - Admin should see: 501 students, 50 teachers
   - Teacher should see: student lists and analytics
   - Student should see: attendance, marks, assignments

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot connect to Railway"
**Solution:**
- Verify credentials are typed correctly
- Check Railway MySQL is running (green status)
- Try connecting from Railway dashboard first

### Problem: "Seeding takes too long"
**Solution:**
- This is normal - creating 680,000+ records takes time
- Wait 10 minutes maximum
- Check Railway dashboard for activity

### Problem: "Vercel still shows 500 errors"
**Solution:**
- Make sure ALL environment variables are added
- Check no typos in variable names
- Redeploy after adding variables
- Check Vercel function logs: `vercel logs`

### Problem: "Login doesn't work"
**Solution:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes after redeployment
- Clear browser cache
- Check password: `Admin@123456` (capital A)
- Verify database has users: run `node check-railway-db.js`
