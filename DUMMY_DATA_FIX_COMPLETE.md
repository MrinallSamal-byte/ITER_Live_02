# Dummy Data Display Fix - Complete ✅

## Problem Identified
The dummy data was not being displayed across all pages and sections. Loading indicators were stuck showing "Loading..." messages while the actual data wasn't populating the UI elements.

## Root Cause
The page-specific JavaScript files were not properly:
1. Calling the DummyData functions correctly
2. Handling cases where DummyData might be undefined
3. Providing hardcoded fallback data when needed
4. Properly updating all DOM elements with data

  if (typeof DummyData !== 'undefined') {
    response = DummyData.getFunction();
  } else {
    // Use hardcoded fallback
    response = { success: true, data: [...] };
  }
}
