## 🎯 What You Need from Me

**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes

**What You Need:**
1. ✅ **Azure Account** - [Create free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) if you don't have one
2. ✅ **Azure CLI** - [Download for Windows](https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows)

**Steps:**
```powershell

# 2. Open PowerShell in your project folder
cd C:\All_In_One_College_Website

# 3. Login to Azure
