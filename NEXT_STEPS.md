- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Write JSDoc comments for all functions
- Use meaningful variable/function names
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines)
- Avoid code duplication

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/phase-7-mobile-nav

# Make changes and commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add mobile bottom navigation"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/phase-7-mobile-nav
```

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests alongside features (TDD)
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Run tests before committing
- Use CI/CD for automated testing

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load non-critical resources
- Optimize images and assets
- Use caching strategically
