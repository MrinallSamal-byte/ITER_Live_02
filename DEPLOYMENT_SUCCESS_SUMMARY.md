## 🚀 Deployment Process Used

### 1. Azure Attempt (Failed)
- ❌ Azure for Students subscription had regional restrictions
- ❌ Could not deploy to any region due to policy constraints

### 2. Alternative Solution (Success)
- ✅ **Railway** for MySQL database hosting
- ✅ **Vercel** for frontend and backend hosting
- ✅ Serverless architecture for scalability

### 3. Configuration Steps
1. Created Railway MySQL database
2. Configured Vercel project
3. Set up environment variables
4. Modified `vercel.json` for serverless routing
5. Created `api/index.js` as serverless entry point
6. Deployed using Vercel CLI
