- **Public Download**: `c:\ITER_Live-main\client\downloads\ITER_EduHub.apk`

### 2. **Server Configuration** ✅
The server has been configured to serve APK files with proper MIME types:

// Serve downloads folder (for APK files)
app.use('/downloads', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client/downloads'), {
  setHeaders: (res, path) => {
    if (path.endsWith('.apk')) {
      res.set('Content-Type', 'application/vnd.android.package-archive');
      res.set('Content-Disposition', 'attachment; filename="ITER_EduHub.apk"');
    }
  }
}));
```

### 3. **Landing Page Download Button** ✅

- **Enabled** (removed disabled state)
- **Linked** to `/downloads/ITER_EduHub.apk`
- **Enhanced** with download attribute for automatic download
- **Updated** with compatibility note

## 📱 Download URL

Once the server is running, users can download the Android app from:
```
https://yourdomain.com/downloads/ITER_EduHub.apk
```

Or locally:
```
http://localhost:5000/downloads/ITER_EduHub.apk
```

## 🔄 Rebuilding the APK

Whenever you need to rebuild and update the APK:

### Option 1: Using PowerShell Script (Recommended)
```powershell

### Option 2: Using Gradle Directly
```powershell
cd c:\ITER_Live-main\android-app
.\gradlew assembleRelease

2. **HTTPS Required**: Make sure your backend URL uses HTTPS in production

3. **Update Backend URL**: Edit `android-app/app/src/main/java/com/iter/eduhub/utils/Constants.kt`:

   const val BASE_URL = "https://your-production-domain.com"
   ```
