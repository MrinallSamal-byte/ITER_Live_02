### Step 3: Build & Run (2 minutes)
1. Connect Android device OR start emulator
2. Click the green Run button (▶️) or press Shift+F10
3. Select your device
4. Wait for build and installation
5. **APP LAUNCHES!** 🎉

### Quick Test Checklist
```
[ ] App launches successfully
[ ] Website loads (make sure backend URL is correct!)
[ ] Login works (test with: STU20250001 / Student@123)
[ ] Navigate to dashboard pages
[ ] Upload works (profile photo)
[ ] Download works (any PDF)
[ ] Back button works
[ ] Pull to refresh works
[ ] Offline page shows (turn off WiFi)
```

## 🔧 Optional: Setup Firebase (For Push Notifications)

If you want push notifications:

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   https://console.firebase.google.com/

2. **Create/Select Project**

3. **Add Android App:**
   - Package name: `com.iter.eduhub`
   - Download `google-services.json`

4. **Place file:**
   Save `google-services.json` to:
   `android-app/app/google-services.json`

5. **Sync Gradle:**
   File > Sync Project with Gradle Files

**Skip if you don't need notifications** - app works fine without it!

## 📦 Building Release APK

When ready to distribute:

### Quick Build (for testing):
```bash
cd android-app
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
APK location: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Production Build (for release):
```bash
cd android-app
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
APK location: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

**Note:** Release build requires signing (see BUILD_GUIDE.md for details)

## 🎨 Optional Customization

### Change App Name:
Edit: `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`
```xml
<string name="app_name">Your App Name</string>
```

### Change Theme Colors:
Edit: `app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml`
```xml
<color name="primary">#YOUR_COLOR</color>
```

### Add App Icon:

2. New > Image Asset
3. Icon Type: Launcher Icons
4. Upload your logo image
5. Click Finish

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Gradle sync failed"
**Solution:**
```bash
./gradlew clean
```
Then File > Sync Project with Gradle Files

### Issue: "WebView shows blank page"
**Checklist:**
- ✅ Backend URL updated in Constants.kt?
- ✅ Backend deployed and accessible?
- ✅ Using HTTPS (not HTTP)?
- ✅ Test URL in mobile browser first

### Issue: "Cannot resolve symbol R"
**Solution:**
1. Build > Clean Project
2. Build > Rebuild Project
3. File > Invalidate Caches > Restart

### Issue: "App crashes on launch"
**Solution:**
```bash
# View logs
adb logcat | grep ITEREduHub

# Clear app data
adb shell pm clear com.iter.eduhub

# Rebuild
./gradlew clean assembleDebug
```
