## 🖼️ Icon Design Tips

### For SOA Logo:
1. **Background Color**: Use `#6366f1` (app primary) or white
2. **Shape**: Circle or Square (Circle looks better for university logos)
3. **Padding**: Add 10-15% padding around the logo
4. **Format**: PNG with transparency

### Quality Guidelines:
- Use high-resolution source (at least 512x512)
- Keep design simple and recognizable
- Ensure logo is centered
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds
- Preview on actual device

## 📱 Adaptive Icons (Android 8+)

For modern Android devices, you can create adaptive icons:

### Structure:
```
res/
├── mipmap-anydpi-v26/
│   └── ic_launcher.xml (Adaptive icon definition)
├── drawable/
│   ├── ic_launcher_background.xml (Background layer)
│   └── ic_launcher_foreground.xml (Foreground layer - your logo)
```

### Using Android Studio:
When you use the Image Asset tool, Android Studio automatically creates adaptive icons!

---

## 🔔 Notification Icon

Your app also needs a notification icon (white, simple, transparent background):

### Create Notification Icon:
1. In Android Studio: `res` > New > Image Asset
2. Icon Type: **Notification Icons**
3. Upload a simplified version of your logo (or use ic_notification.xml already created)
4. It will automatically create `drawable/ic_notification.xml`

**Already created:** Your project has `drawable/ic_notification.xml`

---

## ✅ Quick Verification

After setting up icons, verify:

```
app/src/main/res/
