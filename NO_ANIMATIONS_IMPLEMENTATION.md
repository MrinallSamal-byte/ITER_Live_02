## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### CSS Strategy:
```css
/* Global override */
* {
    animation: none !important;
    transition: none !important;
}

/* Instant visual feedback */
.btn:hover {
    opacity: 0.9; /* Instant opacity change */
}

.glass-card:hover {
    box-shadow: 0 12px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Instant shadow */
}
```

### JavaScript Strategy:
```javascript
// Override requestAnimationFrame
window.requestAnimationFrame = function(callback) {
    callback(Date.now()); // Execute immediately
    return 0;
};

// Disable counters
const counter = element;
counter.textContent = counter.dataset.target; // Show final value
```
