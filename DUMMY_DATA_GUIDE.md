## Overview

This system provides **realistic, varied dummy data** for all users across **every page** of the college management website. Whether you're a student, teacher, or admin, you'll see complete, believable data immediately after login.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Full Database Seed (Recommended for Fresh Start)

```bash
# Seed complete database with 500 students, 50 teachers, realistic data
npm run seed:comprehensive
```

**This creates:**

- ✅ Complete marks data (internals, assignments, quizzes, externals)
- ✅ 30+ Events with registrations
- ✅ 10 Active clubs
- ✅ Complete timetables for all classes
- ✅ 90 days of hostel menu

### Option 2: Automatic Data on Registration

**New users automatically get dummy data!**

When a student or teacher registers through the UI, the system **automatically generates:**
- Attendance records (last 60 days)
- Marks across all subjects
- Fee records
- Admit cards

## 🎨 Data Variations

### Why Data Varies Per User

Each user gets **unique, realistic data**:

1. **Attendance**: Base percentage (70-98%) with daily variations
2. **Marks**: Base performance level (65-95%) with exam-to-exam changes
3. **Names**: 500+ combinations of authentic Indian names
4. **Dates**: Realistic timelines (past 60 days for attendance, varied assignment deadlines)
5. **Subjects**: Department-specific (CSE gets DS, Algo; CIVIL gets Structures, Surveying, etc.)

### Realistic Patterns

- **Attendance**: Most students have 85-95%, some 70-80% (realistic)
- **Marks**: Internal marks vary ±10% from base, assignments slightly higher
- **Assignments**: ~70% submission rate for past assignments
- **Events**: Random registration (40-60% of students)
- **Files**: High download counts for popular subjects

## 🛠️ Customization

### Modify Data Ranges

Edit `client/js/dummy-data.js`:

```javascript
// Change attendance range
const attendancePercent = getRandomInt(70, 98); // Currently 70-98%

// Change performance range
const basePerformance = getRandomInt(65, 95); // Currently 65-95%
```

### Add More Subjects

Edit both files:
- `client/js/dummy-data.js`
- `server/seed/comprehensive-seed.js`

```javascript
const subjects = {
  CSE: ['Data Structures', 'Algorithms', /* add more */],
  // ...
};
```

### Modify User Counts

Edit `server/seed/comprehensive-seed.js`:

```javascript
// Change student count (line ~120)
for (let i = 0; i < 500; i++) { // Change 500 to desired count
  // ...
}

// Change teacher count (line ~90)
for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) { // Change 50 to desired count
  // ...
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Seed Script Fails

**Issue:** Database connection error
```
Solution: Check .env file for correct DB credentials
```

**Issue:** Out of memory
```
Solution: Reduce user count in comprehensive-seed.js
```

### Dummy Data Not Showing

**Issue:** Old cached data
```
Solution: Clear browser localStorage and refresh
```

**Issue:** API returning real (empty) data
```
Solution: Check if backend is running. Dummy data is fallback.
```

### Registration Not Auto-Generating

**Issue:** autoDataGenerator service not loaded
```
Solution: Check server logs for errors. Restart server.
```
