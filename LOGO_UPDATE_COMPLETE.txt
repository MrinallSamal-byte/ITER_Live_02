1. ✓ Updated landing page navigation to use new SOA logo
2. ✓ Enhanced CSS styling for circular logo display
3. ✓ Added white background and shadow for better visibility
4. ✓ Increased logo size from 40px to 50px for better prominence

📁 MANUAL STEP REQUIRED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Please save the SOA University logo image (the circular red and green logo you provided) as:

   📍 Location: c:\All_In_One_College_Website\client\assets\soa-logo.png
   
   ⚠️ Important: Make sure to save it as "soa-logo.png" (without quotes)

🎨 LOGO SPECIFICATIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The logo should be:
   • Circular shape
   • Red border with text "SIKSHA 'O' ANUSANDHAN (DEEMED TO BE UNIVERSITY)"
   • Green triangle/eye symbol in center
   • PNG format with transparent or white background
   • Recommended size: 500x500px or larger (will be scaled to 50x50px)

📝 CHANGES MADE TO CODE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ client/index.html:
   - Changed logo source from "assets/logo.png" to "assets/soa-logo.png"
   - Updated alt text to "Siksha 'O' Anusandhan (Deemed to be University)"
   - Changed logo text from "SOA" to "ITER"

✅ client/css/style.css:
   - Increased logo size to 50x50px
   - Added circular border-radius (50%)
   - Added white background with padding
   - Added subtle shadow for depth
   - Set object-fit: contain to preserve aspect ratio

🚀 HOW TO SAVE THE LOGO:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Option 1: Right-click the logo image → Save As → Navigate to folder above
Option 2: Download the image and rename it to "soa-logo.png"
Option 3: Copy-paste into the assets folder with correct filename

🎯 VERIFICATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After saving the logo, refresh the landing page:
   
   1. Open: http://localhost:3000/index.html
   2. Check the top-left corner of the navigation bar
   3. You should see the circular SOA logo next to "ITER EduHub"

✨ EXPECTED RESULT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The SOA University logo will appear:
   ✓ In the navigation bar (top-left)
   ✓ Circular shape with white background
   ✓ Proper size (50x50px)
   ✓ With a subtle shadow effect
   ✓ Professional and prominent display

🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If logo doesn't appear:
   ❌ Check filename is exactly "soa-logo.png" (case-sensitive)
   ❌ Verify it's in the correct folder: client\assets\
   ❌ Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5)
   ❌ Check browser console for 404 errors

💡 ADDITIONAL NOTES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• The logo will automatically scale and maintain its aspect ratio
• The circular styling ensures it looks professional
• The white background ensures visibility on any navbar color
• The shadow adds depth and makes it stand out

🎉 ALL SET! Just save the logo file and you're done! 🎉
